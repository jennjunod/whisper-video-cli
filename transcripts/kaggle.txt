I mean, we are live. Yay. Go us. Yay. Uh, yeah. So, hello beautiful human. We're still going to learn Python. We're just going to possibly do it a different way than with J because J is not here But now that we're doing it as we have something more open to do, like that we have a framework that's not not reliant on one person. Because I think that was the biggest thing was having J do it was we would be reliant on one person and with all of our schedules that just wasn't going to work
But now that we're doing it as we have something more open to do, like that we have a framework that's not not reliant on one person. Because I think that was the biggest thing was having J do it was we would be reliant on one person and with all of our schedules that just wasn't going to work Yeah, that makes sense. So, figured I will set my schedule to stream weekly and then we'll see who shows up to stream with us. And you're here. Yay. Now, how do we want to learn today? We were talking about code. We're talking. Pretty code bootcamp is what I think we were talking about before
Yeah, that makes sense. So, figured I will set my schedule to stream weekly and then we'll see who shows up to stream with us. And you're here. Yay. Now, how do we want to learn today? We were talking about code. We're talking. Pretty code bootcamp is what I think we were talking about before Um, so for those who are tuning in for the first time, learning with J, um, which could be his own show kind of like learning with Jason, but learning with J. J has been very like hands on and just gives us like a hey, this is an idea to go check out something. And that's how the show used to be
Um, so for those who are tuning in for the first time, learning with J, um, which could be his own show kind of like learning with Jason, but learning with J. J has been very like hands on and just gives us like a hey, this is an idea to go check out something. And that's how the show used to be It teach and tech used to be very hey, I'm just going to go learn whatever somebody teaches me
It teach and tech used to be very hey, I'm just going to go learn whatever somebody teaches me But it didn't always have structure to be able to go back and verify my learnings and I found that was very hard with trying to get people to learn along with me, but then also for my own reference points to go back to the learnings
But it didn't always have structure to be able to go back and verify my learnings and I found that was very hard with trying to get people to learn along with me, but then also for my own reference points to go back to the learnings So, I might get we're going to go through the book of automate more and stuff like we talked about or we were thinking of trying free code camp. Do you want to share your screen of your Googles of what we should learn or how we should learn? Um, I don't think anyone should see my rules
So, I might get we're going to go through the book of automate more and stuff like we talked about or we were thinking of trying free code camp. Do you want to share your screen of your Googles of what we should learn or how we should learn? Um, I don't think anyone should see my rules I remember when people I would share like my, um, my chat to be T history. But it was like when it first came out, so I've literally didn't use it for anything goal. And then I was like, oh no, no, no, nobody gets to see my chat to be T
I remember when people I would share like my, um, my chat to be T history. But it was like when it first came out, so I've literally didn't use it for anything goal. And then I was like, oh no, no, no, nobody gets to see my chat to be T Um, but was that a yes, you want to share your screen or no as you research it? Not that one. This one. Yay. So it looks like this is what we are going to stick with for better or for worse, we're going to be married to this thing. At least for this string. Maybe for future strings
Um, but was that a yes, you want to share your screen or no as you research it? Not that one. This one. Yay. So it looks like this is what we are going to stick with for better or for worse, we're going to be married to this thing. At least for this string. Maybe for future strings Aaron, not the boss of me. But okay. Click begin course. And this is fun. I'm over there. Let's go. I, I totally get it. I get it. Uh, we are going to read some of this out loud. Mostly that's for me because I understand the stuff better. I don't skip words. I'm very dyslexic
Aaron, not the boss of me. But okay. Click begin course. And this is fun. I'm over there. Let's go. I, I totally get it. I get it. Uh, we are going to read some of this out loud. Mostly that's for me because I understand the stuff better. I don't skip words. I'm very dyslexic I'm very dyslexic. So I skip words a lot. So if I read out loud, at least I'm least likely to. Uh, hello, by the way. There's a lot of reading, but you know, it looks better than a book. This is two paragraphs to get to some code. Let's do it
I'm very dyslexic. So I skip words a lot. So if I read out loud, at least I'm least likely to. Uh, hello, by the way. There's a lot of reading, but you know, it looks better than a book. This is two paragraphs to get to some code. Let's do it Let's do it. A quick introduction to Python syntax variable assignment and numbers tutorial. Uh, this course covers keep Python skills you'll need so you can start using Python for data science
Let's do it. A quick introduction to Python syntax variable assignment and numbers tutorial. Uh, this course covers keep Python skills you'll need so you can start using Python for data science The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience who wants to add Python to their repertoire. If you're a first-hand coder, you're encouraged to check out our interactive programming course, which is designed for complete beginners who would like to get started with Python
The course is ideal for someone with some previous coding experience who wants to add Python to their repertoire. If you're a first-hand coder, you're encouraged to check out our interactive programming course, which is designed for complete beginners who would like to get started with Python Sure. I mean, I feel like you and I both have like a smidge of coding experience. Yeah, just a small bit. I have deployed websites before and I've done workshops. I think post workshops. I feel like we'll leave some bounds ahead of me, but I'm here for the right of the student. All right
Sure. I mean, I feel like you and I both have like a smidge of coding experience. Yeah, just a small bit. I have deployed websites before and I've done workshops. I think post workshops. I feel like we'll leave some bounds ahead of me, but I'm here for the right of the student. All right All right. We'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment and arithmetic operators. I'm staring at that word because that is not where I would have gone with that word. How to guess what the word was. It's cool. Hello, a Python
All right. We'll start with a brief overview of Python syntax, variable assignment and arithmetic operators. I'm staring at that word because that is not where I would have gone with that word. How to guess what the word was. It's cool. Hello, a Python Hello, a Python. Python was named for the British comedy trope, multi Python. So we'll make our first Python program homage to their skit about span. Just for fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what is going to do when you run. If you have no idea, that's fine
Hello, a Python. Python was named for the British comedy trope, multi Python. So we'll make our first Python program homage to their skit about span. Just for fun, try reading over the code below and predicting what is going to do when you run. If you have no idea, that's fine Then click the output button to see the results of our program. I'm not going to click output yet. Spam, expand, expand, expand, expand. For more certain to span. If spam is less. If you have a spam, you can use it. That's greater than zero print. I don't want this spam. Print by hands on. Okay
Then click the output button to see the results of our program. I'm not going to click output yet. Spam, expand, expand, expand, expand. For more certain to span. If spam is less. If you have a spam, you can use it. That's greater than zero print. I don't want this spam. Print by hands on. Okay Okay. Why would we put. Spam plus four. Why would anybody want? That's where I'm getting stuck on this coding stuff. I don't want to be. I don't want to be. I don't want to be. I need to watch. Well, what do you think it's going to be? It is. Greater than zero. It's going to print two things
Okay. Why would we put. Spam plus four. Why would anybody want? That's where I'm getting stuck on this coding stuff. I don't want to be. I don't want to be. I don't want to be. I need to watch. Well, what do you think it's going to be? It is. Greater than zero. It's going to print two things Fam amount equals zero. So print spam amount. But if spam. I guess I'm not sure what the where it would say what the input is. Because is that just this line up here? And then why would we put these down here? I think they're both considered inputs. Well. But there's two. Though
Fam amount equals zero. So print spam amount. But if spam. I guess I'm not sure what the where it would say what the input is. Because is that just this line up here? And then why would we put these down here? I think they're both considered inputs. Well. But there's two. Though Though. Yeah, I think there's two prints spam times spam amount. What should be four. So it would say. Spam four times. Then right above. But I don't want any more spam or don't want any more spam. I don't want any spam. Jesus. So is it going to write. Spam amount zero. So it's going to print
Though. Yeah, I think there's two prints spam times spam amount. What should be four. So it would say. Spam four times. Then right above. But I don't want any more spam or don't want any more spam. I don't want any spam. Jesus. So is it going to write. Spam amount zero. So it's going to print I don't want any spam. And then it's going to write the Viking song. Which is spam time spam amount. So. Four spams. All right. Any any guesses on what this will say before we hit show. I'm going to take a drinking break. I'm not seeing any comments. I'm going to click it. Show him no. Zero
I don't want any spam. And then it's going to write the Viking song. Which is spam time spam amount. So. Four spams. All right. Any any guesses on what this will say before we hit show. I'm going to take a drinking break. I'm not seeing any comments. I'm going to click it. Show him no. Zero Show him no. Zero. But I don't want any spam. Spam. You're right. Don't even need the chapter. Spam. We did it. There's a lot of time back here. This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what program code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom
Show him no. Zero. But I don't want any spam. Spam. You're right. Don't even need the chapter. Spam. We did it. There's a lot of time back here. This silly program demonstrates many important aspects of what program code looks like and how it works. Let's review the code from top to bottom Spam underscore amount equals zero. I can't wait to weigh this is set up. Sorry. It's like breaking down each line of code. I don't know how I like it. I think it's good to see the same. I don't know how much I like it. It's good to see the same. It's good to see the same
Spam underscore amount equals zero. I can't wait to weigh this is set up. Sorry. It's like breaking down each line of code. I don't know how I like it. I think it's good to see the same. I don't know how much I like it. It's good to see the same. It's good to see the same I feel like that is something that happens. What? Let me say your name. Those lawyers. It's a very ADHD friendly tool. But it goes back and is like, hey, here's everything. So, spam underscore amount equals zero. Is a variable variable assignment
I feel like that is something that happens. What? Let me say your name. Those lawyers. It's a very ADHD friendly tool. But it goes back and is like, hey, here's everything. So, spam underscore amount equals zero. Is a variable variable assignment Here we create a variable called spam underscore amount and is signed to the value of use of zero using equal sign, which is called the assignment operator. No, if you programed in other languages like Java or C++, you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here
Here we create a variable called spam underscore amount and is signed to the value of use of zero using equal sign, which is called the assignment operator. No, if you programed in other languages like Java or C++, you might be noticing some things Python doesn't require us to do here We don't need to declare spam amount before assigning it, assigning to it. And we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam amount to refer to a different thing like a string or a bullion
We don't need to declare spam amount before assigning it, assigning to it. And we don't need to tell Python what type of value spam amount is going to refer to. In fact, we can even go on to reassign spam amount to refer to a different thing like a string or a bullion Ah, yes, what I was doing last week or the week before. That's actually a good clarification because I kept thinking that we do need to declare what it is. Because I think we do that in JavaScript too. Yeah, like declaring it a bear. Yeah, that's what I was trying to do last time
Ah, yes, what I was doing last week or the week before. That's actually a good clarification because I kept thinking that we do need to declare what it is. Because I think we do that in JavaScript too. Yeah, like declaring it a bear. Yeah, that's what I was trying to do last time And J was like, you're almost there and I'm like, I don't. I'm here. I don't get it. I saw me in the make clips from last week. So, I'm going to come. So, and then print. What did we decide these are called? Are these parentheses? Yes, those are parentheses
And J was like, you're almost there and I'm like, I don't. I'm here. I don't get it. I saw me in the make clips from last week. So, I'm going to come. So, and then print. What did we decide these are called? Are these parentheses? Yes, those are parentheses So, like I need to put a sticky note on my computer. These are parentheses. These are currently brackets. Square brackets. Print parentheses spam underscore amount parentheses zero. Function calls print is a Python function that plays the value past to. Pass to it on the screen
So, like I need to put a sticky note on my computer. These are parentheses. These are currently brackets. Square brackets. Print parentheses spam underscore amount parentheses zero. Function calls print is a Python function that plays the value past to. Pass to it on the screen We call functions by putting parentheses after their name and putting the inputs or arguments to the function. And those parentheses. Anyone else get confused with arguments? Because it makes me think about like arguments like
We call functions by putting parentheses after their name and putting the inputs or arguments to the function. And those parentheses. Anyone else get confused with arguments? Because it makes me think about like arguments like Rumpy people, not arguments like how to think about it on a mathematical. I mean, you can think about it as. Rumpy people that are doing math that makes it easier for you. I mean, that's a great way to think about our humans. Rumpy people doing math. Maybe that'll help. I don't know. We'll see
Rumpy people, not arguments like how to think about it on a mathematical. I mean, you can think about it as. Rumpy people that are doing math that makes it easier for you. I mean, that's a great way to think about our humans. Rumpy people doing math. Maybe that'll help. I don't know. We'll see We'll see. We'll see. All right. And. Okay. And then something that is good to know for learning. If I didn't know any programming and I know that I would have asked this back of then. Would be that the. Pound or hashtag ordering spam a spam spam. Big in and spam for. For more servings of spam
We'll see. We'll see. All right. And. Okay. And then something that is good to know for learning. If I didn't know any programming and I know that I would have asked this back of then. Would be that the. Pound or hashtag ordering spam a spam spam. Big in and spam for. For more servings of spam This is all actually commented out meaning that it doesn't go into the code. I say that because if I didn't have any coding experience, I wouldn't realize that was commented out. I was for you how to do that. And I realize in. Python is just adding the number symbol. Look different in
This is all actually commented out meaning that it doesn't go into the code. I say that because if I didn't have any coding experience, I wouldn't realize that was commented out. I was for you how to do that. And I realize in. Python is just adding the number symbol. Look different in Look different in. It's different. I believe. So the first line above is a comment. And Python comments begin with the hashtag symbol or. Pound or number symbol. Next, we see example of reassignment reassigning the value of a sting variable looks just the same as creating a variable
Look different in. It's different. I believe. So the first line above is a comment. And Python comments begin with the hashtag symbol or. Pound or number symbol. Next, we see example of reassignment reassigning the value of a sting variable looks just the same as creating a variable It still uses the equal sign in assignment operator. In this case, the value we're assigning to spam amount involves a simple arithmetic on its
It still uses the equal sign in assignment operator. In this case, the value we're assigning to spam amount involves a simple arithmetic on its The previous sorry, I had it's previous value when it encounters this line Python evaluates the expression on the right hand side equal zero plus four equals zero. And then assigns a value to the variable on the left hand side
The previous sorry, I had it's previous value when it encounters this line Python evaluates the expression on the right hand side equal zero plus four equals zero. And then assigns a value to the variable on the left hand side And five if spam amount is greater than zero print, but I don't want any spam. Viking song equals spam spam spam print Viking song. I think they're missing a spam here should be four spams
And five if spam amount is greater than zero print, but I don't want any spam. Viking song equals spam spam spam print Viking song. I think they're missing a spam here should be four spams We won't talk much about conditions until later, but even if you never coded before you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and simplicity. Note how we indicate with. How we indicate which code belongs to if. What we're spam is supposed to be printed if
We won't talk much about conditions until later, but even if you never coded before you can probably guess what this does. Python is prized for its readability and simplicity. Note how we indicate with. How we indicate which code belongs to if. What we're spam is supposed to be printed if Spam amount is positive later in code like print Viking song should be executed no matter what. How do we how do we and Python know that. The colon. At the end of the line if indicates that a new code block is started subsequent lines which are indented are part of the code block
Spam amount is positive later in code like print Viking song should be executed no matter what. How do we how do we and Python know that. The colon. At the end of the line if indicates that a new code block is started subsequent lines which are indented are part of the code block So this is something that Jay was getting on me about because I was not indenting my code. And I guess in Python like that's that's what you do if you just you have to indent it if you want to coincide or go with the code that you were setting up before
So this is something that Jay was getting on me about because I was not indenting my code. And I guess in Python like that's that's what you do if you just you have to indent it if you want to coincide or go with the code that you were setting up before And my it statements look like trash because I was not doing that. And I was reading my semicolon a lot too which is just yeah. I feel like that's something very different that's harder to learn with compared to like JavaScript because JavaScript doesn't do
And my it statements look like trash because I was not doing that. And I was reading my semicolon a lot too which is just yeah. I feel like that's something very different that's harder to learn with compared to like JavaScript because JavaScript doesn't do In dense as much at least that I remember like you don't have to do. You don't have to do it and same with them and producer HTML and CSS like you don't have to do in dense the way Python does you definitely don't have to do it in CSS or HTML
In dense as much at least that I remember like you don't have to do. You don't have to do it and same with them and producer HTML and CSS like you don't have to do in dense the way Python does you definitely don't have to do it in CSS or HTML And if you ever coded before you might know that some other languages use curly braces on the mark or to mark the beginning and end of code blocks Python uses or Python's use of meaningful whites based can be surprising to some programmers who are accustomed to other languages
And if you ever coded before you might know that some other languages use curly braces on the mark or to mark the beginning and end of code blocks Python uses or Python's use of meaningful whites based can be surprising to some programmers who are accustomed to other languages But in practice it can lead to more consistent readable code the languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. That makes sense. The later lines dealing with Viking song are not indented with an extra four spaces so they are not part of the if's code block
But in practice it can lead to more consistent readable code the languages that do not enforce indentation of code blocks. That makes sense. The later lines dealing with Viking song are not indented with an extra four spaces so they are not part of the if's code block We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions using loops. This code snippet is also our first citing in string of a string and Python but I don't want any spam
We'll see more examples of indented code blocks later when we define functions using loops. This code snippet is also our first citing in string of a string and Python but I don't want any spam So string can be marked either by double or say the quotation marks but because this particular string contains a single quote character we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single quotes less word careful. I'm going back up. Yeah, because it
So string can be marked either by double or say the quotation marks but because this particular string contains a single quote character we might confuse Python by trying to surround it with single quotes less word careful. I'm going back up. Yeah, because it Yeah, because it. So so I'm not going to look at five because five is missing the spam's the fourth spam. I'm going to look at the very beginning by it. If spam is greater than zero that print has the quotes because it's not referring to something that was declared
Yeah, because it. So so I'm not going to look at five because five is missing the spam's the fourth spam. I'm going to look at the very beginning by it. If spam is greater than zero that print has the quotes because it's not referring to something that was declared No, what it's saying and specifically the quote is because don't has an apostrophe in it. It doesn't want to use the single quotes. So you know how in quotes you can use the. quotation mark or the single quotation mark which is called parentheses not parentheses. Oh my god
No, what it's saying and specifically the quote is because don't has an apostrophe in it. It doesn't want to use the single quotes. So you know how in quotes you can use the. quotation mark or the single quotation mark which is called parentheses not parentheses. Oh my god Oh my god. I just use the word blank. I'm nervous. What else are they called the post. Apostrophe. Yes, that is that is what it's called apostrophe
Oh my god. I just use the word blank. I'm nervous. What else are they called the post. Apostrophe. Yes, that is that is what it's called apostrophe It doesn't use it doesn't want to use apostrophe because it has the or it doesn't want to use single quote because it has an apostrophe in it and it takes it all throw it off. I'm assuming Viking underscore song equals spam times spam amount or spam underscore mount print Viking song
It doesn't use it doesn't want to use apostrophe because it has the or it doesn't want to use single quote because it has an apostrophe in it and it takes it all throw it off. I'm assuming Viking underscore song equals spam times spam amount or spam underscore mount print Viking song I'm not going to say underscores gives you four spamps the star or asterisk or multiplier operator can be used to multiply two numbers three times three. And value evaluate that's the word
I'm not going to say underscores gives you four spamps the star or asterisk or multiplier operator can be used to multiply two numbers three times three. And value evaluate that's the word Is that the word? Why would you use a value way to that? Okay, yeah, that's what I would assume would have been a bit of value. I just let's look up a value. I feel like that's the correct term for it. I just didn't expect that it would be used in that sentence. Python uses a value. It's okay
Is that the word? Why would you use a value way to that? Okay, yeah, that's what I would assume would have been a bit of value. I just let's look up a value. I feel like that's the correct term for it. I just didn't expect that it would be used in that sentence. Python uses a value. It's okay It's okay. Thank you Aaron
It's okay. Thank you Aaron I value it to nine, but we can use multiply as a string by a number to get the version that's been repeated many times Python offers a number of cheeky little times, maybe tricks like this where operators like times and add have different meanings depending on what kind of thing they're applied to the technical term for this is operating operator overloading numbers and arithmetic and Python
I value it to nine, but we can use multiply as a string by a number to get the version that's been repeated many times Python offers a number of cheeky little times, maybe tricks like this where operators like times and add have different meanings depending on what kind of thing they're applied to the technical term for this is operating operator overloading numbers and arithmetic and Python We've already seen examples of variable containing a number above in seven popcorn chain numbers and arithmetic and Python
We've already seen examples of variable containing a number above in seven popcorn chain numbers and arithmetic and Python We've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above in line seven spam underscore amount equals zero number is a fine is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but we wanted if we wanted to be more technical we could ask Python how it would describe it describes the type of thing that is spam amount is in line eight type parentheses spam underscore amount parentheses out line eight int and it's an int short for integer there's some sort of number we commonly encounter in Python in nine type from the C 19
We've already seen an example of a variable containing a number above in line seven spam underscore amount equals zero number is a fine is a fine informal name for the kind of thing, but we wanted if we wanted to be more technical we could ask Python how it would describe it describes the type of thing that is spam amount is in line eight type parentheses spam underscore amount parentheses out line eight int and it's an int short for integer there's some sort of number we commonly encounter in Python in nine type from the C 1995 parentheses out nine float
95 parentheses out nine float Low is a number with a decimal place very useful for representing things like weights or proportions type parentheses is a second built in function we've seen after print parentheses and it's a good thing to remember it's very useful to be able to ask Python what kind of thing is this a natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic
Low is a number with a decimal place very useful for representing things like weights or proportions type parentheses is a second built in function we've seen after print parentheses and it's a good thing to remember it's very useful to be able to ask Python what kind of thing is this a natural thing to want to do with numbers is perform arithmetic We've seen the plus operator for addition and the asterisk operator for multiplication Python also has us covered with the rest of the basic buttons of your calculator one interesting thing to observe is that whereas your calculator probably has one button for division Python can do two kinds true division, which is basically what your calculator does
We've seen the plus operator for addition and the asterisk operator for multiplication Python also has us covered with the rest of the basic buttons of your calculator one interesting thing to observe is that whereas your calculator probably has one button for division Python can do two kinds true division, which is basically what your calculator does I'm lost like I got lost like I kept reading you know maybe if I keep reading i'm going to figure out the answer on this and i'm just. Let me go back to the very beginning thing very beginning let's go
I'm lost like I got lost like I kept reading you know maybe if I keep reading i'm going to figure out the answer on this and i'm just. Let me go back to the very beginning thing very beginning let's go So there are no integers in the thing that we did like we did not declare an integer we did not use it anywhere got it okay so batch number seven. So spam equals zero is a number is fine for an informal name with the kind of thing
So there are no integers in the thing that we did like we did not declare an integer we did not use it anywhere got it okay so batch number seven. So spam equals zero is a number is fine for an informal name with the kind of thing But in line eight type span amount I do you like look at the side by side hold on. I think what it's saying is it's saying in line a if you ask for the type of like what spam matters it's going to give you integer instead of string or. What was the other one really. Really
But in line eight type span amount I do you like look at the side by side hold on. I think what it's saying is it's saying in line a if you ask for the type of like what spam matters it's going to give you integer instead of string or. What was the other one really. Really Really. So I think what it's trying to tell you is. Type is a really good way to figure out what your. Current operators not operator one. Spam. I think. Okay. Okay that does make sense for what Aaron said of honestly very complex way of showing data types but. Keeps opening that
Really. So I think what it's trying to tell you is. Type is a really good way to figure out what your. Current operators not operator one. Spam. I think. Okay. Okay that does make sense for what Aaron said of honestly very complex way of showing data types but. Keeps opening that Keeps opening that. So it's saying that spam amounts is a data type and it was showing that it was an integer. I'm not sure. These are just types okay. All right well. Well. We print can and line 10. Is this supposed to say a line 10 right. And mine time or into. Yeah in time is mine 10 right
Keeps opening that. So it's saying that spam amounts is a data type and it was showing that it was an integer. I'm not sure. These are just types okay. All right well. Well. We print can and line 10. Is this supposed to say a line 10 right. And mine time or into. Yeah in time is mine 10 right I don't think so. Or just in code section. What is this. It's a notebook. Maybe in notebook 10 11 maybe that's it maybe it's a notebook these are all little it a bity Jupiter notebooks. No one backlash gives us oh is that true division but two backlashes give us. Rounded round in number okay
I don't think so. Or just in code section. What is this. It's a notebook. Maybe in notebook 10 11 maybe that's it maybe it's a notebook these are all little it a bity Jupiter notebooks. No one backlash gives us oh is that true division but two backlashes give us. Rounded round in number okay And a float. Is. Something with a decimal. No float has no decimal. I think. Well it's a lot of decimals and then. You correct no floats. Okay. Where do you think this could be useful. Calculator
And a float. Is. Something with a decimal. No float has no decimal. I think. Well it's a lot of decimals and then. You correct no floats. Okay. Where do you think this could be useful. Calculator Calculator. I mean honestly and honestly like if we're just thinking of terms of data science it makes perfect sense for like back in. Information so like if we were trying to calculate. I don't know banking information or. I don't know everything I'm thinking of involves money. Um
Calculator. I mean honestly and honestly like if we're just thinking of terms of data science it makes perfect sense for like back in. Information so like if we were trying to calculate. I don't know banking information or. I don't know everything I'm thinking of involves money. Um Um. That's the only thing that I could come up with is it would have to do with money. I mean. Maybe time. I feel like you wouldn't use. Points. Or maybe. Because I feel like time would be. I don't know. Use in a different way. I don't know if you would use. Loathe for time. Maybe. Oh hey we get a
Um. That's the only thing that I could come up with is it would have to do with money. I mean. Maybe time. I feel like you wouldn't use. Points. Or maybe. Because I feel like time would be. I don't know. Use in a different way. I don't know if you would use. Loathe for time. Maybe. Oh hey we get a Oh hey we get a. Talk about order of operations. Look at that. Look at us. Order of operations. The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions. Mentions about the order of operations. In which order of operations are evaluated. So I'm going to read it. Summary memorities by. Nnemonic
Oh hey we get a. Talk about order of operations. Look at that. Look at us. Order of operations. The arithmetic we learned in primary school has conventions. Mentions about the order of operations. In which order of operations are evaluated. So I'm going to read it. Summary memorities by. Nnemonic Nnemonic. And. Isn't. Yeah it's. It's. Monic such as. Pembe. parentheses. Exponents multiplication division addition subtraction. Python follows similar roles which. So. They're. Mostly pretty intuitive. Order of operations we've read this thing twice
Nnemonic. And. Isn't. Yeah it's. It's. Monic such as. Pembe. parentheses. Exponents multiplication division addition subtraction. Python follows similar roles which. So. They're. Mostly pretty intuitive. Order of operations we've read this thing twice And basically it knows based on this that it will do. I'm pausing because it says. Pundas is parentheses exponent multiplication slash division addition slash. flesh subtraction. And because it says addition first there, I would have done addition of three plus two, which is five
And basically it knows based on this that it will do. I'm pausing because it says. Pundas is parentheses exponent multiplication slash division addition slash. flesh subtraction. And because it says addition first there, I would have done addition of three plus two, which is five And eight, five is three. I would not have done subtracting first. So think about it like this. It says addition of subtraction, but it just means both of those are in the same level of when it can be used. So if they're both on the same line, it's just going left to right
And eight, five is three. I would not have done subtracting first. So think about it like this. It says addition of subtraction, but it just means both of those are in the same level of when it can be used. So if they're both on the same line, it's just going left to right I'm glad we talked about this because reading it, that's not something that would have clicked for me. Other than seeing that the outcome was different is what made it go, oh, that's why. So just think of it as order of operation. So addition and subtraction have the same order
I'm glad we talked about this because reading it, that's not something that would have clicked for me. Other than seeing that the outcome was different is what made it go, oh, that's why. So just think of it as order of operation. So addition and subtraction have the same order So if parentheses is one, exposes to multiplication division three, and then addition subtractions for. And I feel like it makes enough sense for what they're saying here. Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want. Hat height centimeters is 25
So if parentheses is one, exposes to multiplication division three, and then addition subtractions for. And I feel like it makes enough sense for what they're saying here. Sometimes the default order of operations isn't what we want. Hat height centimeters is 25 My hat height centimeters is 190 in the comments. How tell am I in meters and or my height? Seven meters is 190. How tell I am meters wearing that hat? So total height meters equals hat height meters plus my height meters divided by 100. Yeah, because they're doing centimeters
My hat height centimeters is 190 in the comments. How tell am I in meters and or my height? Seven meters is 190. How tell I am meters wearing that hat? So total height meters equals hat height meters plus my height meters divided by 100. Yeah, because they're doing centimeters And they ask for meters. Thank you. Which is weird because I don't know why they would divide by. I'm tripping. So 100 centimeters goes into one meter
And they ask for meters. Thank you. Which is weird because I don't know why they would divide by. I'm tripping. So 100 centimeters goes into one meter Do you see where they messed up at? Yeah, because since they didn't do a parentheses, you would have divided the my height centimeters divided by 100 instead of doing the hat height plus my height before doing the division. Crushed it. Now that I knew what that division was for. Oh, yeah
Do you see where they messed up at? Yeah, because since they didn't do a parentheses, you would have divided the my height centimeters divided by 100 instead of doing the hat height plus my height before doing the division. Crushed it. Now that I knew what that division was for. Oh, yeah Oh, yeah. And then they showed in 15 that they switched it. Built in functions. Okay. I'm going to set popcorn to you, Damian. Because I've been popping that a lot. Okay, built in functions for working with numbers. Men and max return the minimum of maximum other arguments respectively. Respect
Oh, yeah. And then they showed in 15 that they switched it. Built in functions. Okay. I'm going to set popcorn to you, Damian. Because I've been popping that a lot. Okay, built in functions for working with numbers. Men and max return the minimum of maximum other arguments respectively. Respect Respect. Print men 1, 2, 3. Print max 1, 2, 3. 1, 3. Apps returned absolute value of an argument. Print apps 32. Print apps negative 32. 32, 32
Respect. Print men 1, 2, 3. Print max 1, 2, 3. 1, 3. Apps returned absolute value of an argument. Print apps 32. Print apps negative 32. 32, 32 32, 32. In addition to being names of pythons, two main numerables, int and float can be called as functions, which convert their arguments to the corresponding type. Print float 10, print int 3.33. They can even be called on strings print error print int 107 plus 1
32, 32. In addition to being names of pythons, two main numerables, int and float can be called as functions, which convert their arguments to the corresponding type. Print float 10, print int 3.33. They can even be called on strings print error print int 107 plus 1 So float turns into print float turns into 10.0 print int 3.33. Turns into 3 and then print int string of 807 plus 1 turns in 8 away. And as we talked earlier, I think argument me just thinking that it means like equation or whatever makes more sense to me
So float turns into print float turns into 10.0 print int 3.33. Turns into 3 and then print int string of 807 plus 1 turns in 8 away. And as we talked earlier, I think argument me just thinking that it means like equation or whatever makes more sense to me But having to think back absolute value, that makes sense. And this all makes sense to me. Doesn't make sense to you for that. Okay, cool. I think absolute is just like this is going to sound so dumb. I think absolute is an absolutely positive. It's your turn. Now is your chance
But having to think back absolute value, that makes sense. And this all makes sense to me. Doesn't make sense to you for that. Okay, cool. I think absolute is just like this is going to sound so dumb. I think absolute is an absolutely positive. It's your turn. Now is your chance Now is your chance. Try your first python programming. Yes, we have half an hour to do this. We could do this. Oh, all right. This is an exercise in your Python course. You can reference the tutorial in this link. Welcome to your first set of Python coding problems

And also where's my play button? You're playing buttons at the top But is it going to run all of them or just the first one? There's one for run all, but then there's one for run current cell. Yeah, if I click into the cell, it'll play it. Play session starting. Waiting for Jupyter. Trying another line of code and running unit
But is it going to run all of them or just the first one? There's one for run all, but then there's one for run current cell. Yeah, if I click into the cell, it'll play it. Play session starting. Waiting for Jupyter. Trying another line of code and running unit Is this working for anybody else? First for me. Wow, that took a minute. You've successfully run some Python code. Congratulations. Try adding a number line of code in the cell above and re-running it. Right? Well, you will do this
Is this working for anybody else? First for me. Wow, that took a minute. You've successfully run some Python code. Congratulations. Try adding a number line of code in the cell above and re-running it. Right? Well, you will do this Out of curiosity, I'm just going to try this now because I've never tried it. I don't know if I can play an emojis. And I'm all at K. Did you all know a cappernimojis? That is really exciting. I feel like everyone but us two have cappernimojis
Out of curiosity, I'm just going to try this now because I've never tried it. I don't know if I can play an emojis. And I'm all at K. Did you all know a cappernimojis? That is really exciting. I feel like everyone but us two have cappernimojis Yeah, I'm pretty sure nobody else cares if it can print emojis. I'm really excited about a cappernimojis. All right. Now it's time to give a little fancier. Add a new one of new codes, by clicking an existing code cell, hitting the escape key and then hitting a or b key
Yeah, I'm pretty sure nobody else cares if it can print emojis. I'm really excited about a cappernimojis. All right. Now it's time to give a little fancier. Add a new one of new codes, by clicking an existing code cell, hitting the escape key and then hitting a or b key A key will add a cell to the current cell, the b key adds a cell below. Back to my day. Inboaches weren't normal text. I don't think emojis are any text either because I write technical content and I still want to put emojis in it. I have to be told, Jen, you're not putting emojis in your stuff
A key will add a cell to the current cell, the b key adds a cell below. Back to my day. Inboaches weren't normal text. I don't think emojis are any text either because I write technical content and I still want to put emojis in it. I have to be told, Jen, you're not putting emojis in your stuff It's not in a serious but people need to feel the emotion. They don't. All right. Yay! I created a new cell block and I'm going to keep scrolling down. Amy and did you get your new cell block? I put it above. Code cell. Okay
It's not in a serious but people need to feel the emotion. They don't. All right. Yay! I created a new cell block and I'm going to keep scrolling down. Amy and did you get your new cell block? I put it above. Code cell. Okay Code cell. Okay. Each hands on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move on to question zero. Okay. Set up complete. You're ready to answer question zero. Okay. All you. How according to you? Okay
Code cell. Okay. Each hands on exercise starts by setting up our feedback and code checking mechanism. Run the code cell below to do that. Then you'll be ready to move on to question zero. Okay. Set up complete. You're ready to answer question zero. Okay. All you. How according to you? Okay This is a silly question. Instead of the introduction to the format we use for hands-on exercises throughout all cable courses. What is your favorite color? To complete this question, create a variable bug color in the cell below with the appropriate value. The function called q0
This is a silly question. Instead of the introduction to the format we use for hands-on exercises throughout all cable courses. What is your favorite color? To complete this question, create a variable bug color in the cell below with the appropriate value. The function called q0check parentheses, which we've already provided in the cell below, we'll check the answer. We'll check your answer. We'll check youresse. I have not now. It's for this. Maybe. And. And. Incorrect. That's cool. Let's try this. I got even more incorrect. Oops. I didn't print
check parentheses, which we've already provided in the cell below, we'll check the answer. We'll check your answer. We'll check youresse. I have not now. It's for this. Maybe. And. And. Incorrect. That's cool. Let's try this. I got even more incorrect. Oops. I didn't print I didn't print. I should have done private. Um. Incorrect. I think it's not. Special. Special. Special. Um, well. It says incorrect, but it printed green. Because there's a space. I'm sure there's a space. Incorrect. Why is it incorrect? A variable color
I didn't print. I should have done private. Um. Incorrect. I think it's not. Special. Special. Special. Um, well. It says incorrect, but it printed green. Because there's a space. I'm sure there's a space. Incorrect. Why is it incorrect? A variable color Was it an appropriate value on the line below? Remember. Delete the pound. In the line below to make one of the lines run. I'm commenting. Um. That's a great. Yeah, I don't think there's a what makes an appropriate value. Um. And the line below. Oh, hint. We can get a hint
Was it an appropriate value on the line below? Remember. Delete the pound. In the line below to make one of the lines run. I'm commenting. Um. That's a great. Yeah, I don't think there's a what makes an appropriate value. Um. And the line below. Oh, hint. We can get a hint We can get a hint. So I will ask for a hint here. I'm going to ask for a hint. You're favorite color rhymes with glue. My favorite color is not blue. So no. I'm asking for the solution. Are you ready to ask for the solution? I swear to God if it says blue. I'm going to ask for the solution. It is
We can get a hint. So I will ask for a hint here. I'm going to ask for a hint. You're favorite color rhymes with glue. My favorite color is not blue. So no. I'm asking for the solution. Are you ready to ask for the solution? I swear to God if it says blue. I'm going to ask for the solution. It is It is. Why put it? Why would you? We did it right. What is your favorite color? Purple. My favorite color is green. I think it's more frustrating, but there is a correct answer for color. Instead of it. Oh. It's a money Python reference. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Birds of death
It is. Why put it? Why would you? We did it right. What is your favorite color? Purple. My favorite color is green. I think it's more frustrating, but there is a correct answer for color. Instead of it. Oh. It's a money Python reference. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Birds of death Birds of death. What's your favorite color? That could have been a very easy. Easy. That could have been. That could have been a great hint. Instead of saying. Monthly by that question. Yeah. It should have given out the entire saying of. Like in reference to the movie money Python
Birds of death. What's your favorite color? That could have been a very easy. Easy. That could have been. That could have been a great hint. Instead of saying. Monthly by that question. Yeah. It should have given out the entire saying of. Like in reference to the movie money Python What is your favorite? That's. Yeah. What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? In Monte Python. What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? Another solid reference. I'm giving. Yeah. This makes me a grumpy duck
What is your favorite? That's. Yeah. What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? In Monte Python. What is your favorite color? What is your favorite color? Another solid reference. I'm giving. Yeah. This makes me a grumpy duck But. I like the rest of it. So I'm going to continue on. Pass a grumpy duck. Okay. One complete the code below in case. It's helpful. Here's table variable arithmetic operations. Creative variable called radius equal to half diameter
But. I like the rest of it. So I'm going to continue on. Pass a grumpy duck. Okay. One complete the code below in case. It's helpful. Here's table variable arithmetic operations. Creative variable called radius equal to half diameter Creative variable called area using the formula of the area circle pi times the radius squared. Oh, I thought we're going to do it one at a time. But yes. Yeah, well, yes, do it one at a time. But this makes me a little bit. A variable. Radius equals. 0.5 times. Well, I guess it's. So I am
Creative variable called area using the formula of the area circle pi times the radius squared. Oh, I thought we're going to do it one at a time. But yes. Yeah, well, yes, do it one at a time. But this makes me a little bit. A variable. Radius equals. 0.5 times. Well, I guess it's. So I am So I am. Divided by two. And then. This one is called area. It goes. I have a circle. High times radius squared. Oh, I don't know how to do. I'm. Area. Wait. Radius squared is. Double multiplication. Let's catch now. Times times. Do. Correct
So I am. Divided by two. And then. This one is called area. It goes. I have a circle. High times radius squared. Oh, I don't know how to do. I'm. Area. Wait. Radius squared is. Double multiplication. Let's catch now. Times times. Do. Correct Do. Correct. When it's actually doing what's on the screen, we got it right. All right. On to question two. How many questions are there? All right. There's four questions. We. I feel like we got this. Yeah. Um. Add the. What? Good. You can read it. You can read it. Okay. We're going to
Do. Correct. When it's actually doing what's on the screen, we got it right. All right. On to question two. How many questions are there? All right. There's four questions. We. I feel like we got this. Yeah. Um. Add the. What? Good. You can read it. You can read it. Okay. We're going to We're going to. Let's go to our next question. If we want to do that to the code. So by swapping variables a and b so that a refers to the object previous. We refer to. By B and vice versa. Set up the code. Do not touch this part. If you're curious these examples of list
We're going to. Let's go to our next question. If we want to do that to the code. So by swapping variables a and b so that a refers to the object previous. We refer to. By B and vice versa. Set up the code. Do not touch this part. If you're curious these examples of list We'll talk about them in depth in a few lessons from now. For now. It goes over the values and then it says your code goes here swap the values to which A and B refer if you get stuck you can always uncomment one or both the lines in the next cell for a hint or pick a solution
We'll talk about them in depth in a few lessons from now. For now. It goes over the values and then it says your code goes here swap the values to which A and B refer if you get stuck you can always uncomment one or both the lines in the next cell for a hint or pick a solution Right what swap values to which A and B refer. Oops space that's better. This just makes me want to copy and paste them and just switch them. Yeah. I mean you're smarter than me you copy and paste it I typed it all out. So I got a very very long hint
Right what swap values to which A and B refer. Oops space that's better. This just makes me want to copy and paste them and just switch them. Yeah. I mean you're smarter than me you copy and paste it I typed it all out. So I got a very very long hint They want you to use the variables to swap them rather than try and list out yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I think I can understand that. So A should equal C B should equal A and then A should go back to you. Nope nope nope B should equal C and then H D can be at the end
They want you to use the variables to swap them rather than try and list out yourself. Yeah. Yeah. I think I can understand that. So A should equal C B should equal A and then A should go back to you. Nope nope nope B should equal C and then H D can be at the end I think or I just broke the entire group. I have to be able to put C first. I'm like wait which one of my pet me now. Three and they have the same thing. If you read B to A first they're both equal when you do E A. Yeah. C equals A B. Order of operation too. Okay
I think or I just broke the entire group. I have to be able to put C first. I'm like wait which one of my pet me now. Three and they have the same thing. If you read B to A first they're both equal when you do E A. Yeah. C equals A B. Order of operation too. Okay Okay. So you're temporarily making C equal to A. So you're temporarily making C equal A. A changes from being what it used to be to B and then any end B becomes C again or B becomes A by becoming C. I guess that's like the cup game
Okay. So you're temporarily making C equal to A. So you're temporarily making C equal A. A changes from being what it used to be to B and then any end B becomes C again or B becomes A by becoming C. I guess that's like the cup game It makes sense but it doesn't make sense to me because it's like wouldn't that just repeat what we were just doing when we said B equals A and A equals B. Why doesn't it cause a bigger loop? So think of it like this because there's an order of operation
It makes sense but it doesn't make sense to me because it's like wouldn't that just repeat what we were just doing when we said B equals A and A equals B. Why doesn't it cause a bigger loop? So think of it like this because there's an order of operation It there's no loop because it says this equals this. We take this out and move it. So this is now equal to this. So A or C is now A. So C is a copy of A. You take C or you take A and you make it equal to B. A is now a copy of B. You take B and you have it equal to C
It there's no loop because it says this equals this. We take this out and move it. So this is now equal to this. So A or C is now A. So C is a copy of A. You take C or you take A and you make it equal to B. A is now a copy of B. You take B and you have it equal to C It's now a copy of A but there's no loop in that because it's not we're not asking us to do it again. Since that's the last operation that's the last thing we asked the computer. Okay. I'm going to say yes. Like what you guys are saying makes sense. It's like just
It's now a copy of A but there's no loop in that because it's not we're not asking us to do it again. Since that's the last operation that's the last thing we asked the computer. Okay. I'm going to say yes. Like what you guys are saying makes sense. It's like just It's like just. Behind the scenes getting into ketchup. Like part of it makes very sense to me but part of it is just hard to accept. I don't know if that makes sense. But. Okay. I don't know why it says TMP. Oh. Yeah. We demystify a bit. Oh, two pulls
It's like just. Behind the scenes getting into ketchup. Like part of it makes very sense to me but part of it is just hard to accept. I don't know if that makes sense. But. Okay. I don't know why it says TMP. Oh. Yeah. We demystify a bit. Oh, two pulls Oh, two pulls. Hey, that's what a J was talking about last week. I like that intuition will come with practice. Yes. I think that's the hardest thing with learning to code is it's like having to rewire. But it's just not easy. It's not easy. But it's not easy. But all right. We have 14 minutes
Oh, two pulls. Hey, that's what a J was talking about last week. I like that intuition will come with practice. Yes. I think that's the hardest thing with learning to code is it's like having to rewire. But it's just not easy. It's not easy. But it's not easy. But all right. We have 14 minutes We have 14 minutes. Let's do this. I have parentheses the following expressions to the equals one. Got that. Let's go. Well, let's make sure I got that because I think I got it. But you know, pressure. I think that's the hardest thing to do. I think that's the hardest thing to do. We're good. Okay
We have 14 minutes. Let's do this. I have parentheses the following expressions to the equals one. Got that. Let's go. Well, let's make sure I got that because I think I got it. But you know, pressure. I think that's the hardest thing to do. I think that's the hardest thing to do. We're good. Okay We're good. Okay. Uh, three B. This is a pepper. Spicy question. Mark just spicy pepper because it's a bit harder. I've heard the season the following expression to make it equal zero. Okay. Okay. I kind of just want to. I'm going to write. Do. So I'm honestly not looking at this
We're good. Okay. Uh, three B. This is a pepper. Spicy question. Mark just spicy pepper because it's a bit harder. I've heard the season the following expression to make it equal zero. Okay. Okay. I kind of just want to. I'm going to write. Do. So I'm honestly not looking at this I just want to see what. Um, that was definitely not it. It's also just kind of fun to. So. This is definitely not it. It's not a good thing to do. But it was also really fun to do it. Zero. Hi, Tim. Thanks for joining us. We'll be here next week. Same time. Same bad time. Same bad network
I just want to see what. Um, that was definitely not it. It's also just kind of fun to. So. This is definitely not it. It's not a good thing to do. But it was also really fun to do it. Zero. Hi, Tim. Thanks for joining us. We'll be here next week. Same time. Same bad time. Same bad network Same bad network. Oh, I did it. So I did it without meaning to do it because I was just trying to put parentheses in random places. The thing is that I'm not sure. I don't know if this is the best way to do it. I have to try to do it. But the thing is. That's not how I suppose to work. So six
Same bad network. Oh, I did it. So I did it without meaning to do it because I was just trying to put parentheses in random places. The thing is that I'm not sure. I don't know if this is the best way to do it. I have to try to do it. But the thing is. That's not how I suppose to work. So six So six. Minus eight. I was going to say, like putting part of this season when the place is a great place to start trying to learn to do stuff. I agree, but at the same time, what if it's been like 20 characters long. not. Alright let's scroll down to four. It's the last one. All right
So six. Minus eight. I was going to say, like putting part of this season when the place is a great place to start trying to learn to do stuff. I agree, but at the same time, what if it's been like 20 characters long. not. Alright let's scroll down to four. It's the last one. All right All right. Alice, Bob and Carol, there's a missing common. Have agreed to pull their Halloween candy and split it E.L. and mocks themselves for the sake of their friendship. Any candy left over will be smashed. What kind of weird? So they get fully equal
All right. Alice, Bob and Carol, there's a missing common. Have agreed to pull their Halloween candy and split it E.L. and mocks themselves for the sake of their friendship. Any candy left over will be smashed. What kind of weird? So they get fully equal They don't have a gen in their life that will steal all their candy
They don't have a gen in their life that will steal all their candy What kind of okay any candies that's over will be smashed for the for example if they collect if they bring home 91 candies and you take very and smash one with arithmetic expression below calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul
What kind of okay any candies that's over will be smashed for the for example if they collect if they bring home 91 candies and you take very and smash one with arithmetic expression below calculate how many candies they must smash for a given haul I'm trying to figure out what kind of weird suicide packed friendship that they have that they just can't like give away the candies or like break the candy so they can have equal. Side's point
I'm trying to figure out what kind of weird suicide packed friendship that they have that they just can't like give away the candies or like break the candy so they can have equal. Side's point Side's point. You know why? They don't have a gen in their life that will just follow them around until they give them candy. Your code goes here replace the right hand side of the sign. Yeah. What? Can you print an equation? I don't know. Yes. I just want to know the answer not check. I guess
Side's point. You know why? They don't have a gen in their life that will just follow them around until they give them candy. Your code goes here replace the right hand side of the sign. Yeah. What? Can you print an equation? I don't know. Yes. I just want to know the answer not check. I guess I guess. Okay, you're not. Can we can we math this really quick? Make me not want to use. Okay fine. We will do it. We just pull it up on my phone. I was no joke going to just do spotlight search and just like add them all so that way it gave me 307. Okay thanks
I guess. Okay, you're not. Can we can we math this really quick? Make me not want to use. Okay fine. We will do it. We just pull it up on my phone. I was no joke going to just do spotlight search and just like add them all so that way it gave me 307. Okay thanks Okay thanks. See I'm doing it before him because I'm like I don't really think you need have to know the like the exact amount in order to do it. Candy. Okay. No, we're going to get a bracket and I mean the bracket. And that's fair. Thank you bracket. Uh, I'm going to see. Now this
Okay thanks. See I'm doing it before him because I'm like I don't really think you need have to know the like the exact amount in order to do it. Candy. Okay. No, we're going to get a bracket and I mean the bracket. And that's fair. Thank you bracket. Uh, I'm going to see. Now this Now this. No, I mean another one. And object is not calibal because you can't take. Okay, so I will do this. Okay, okay. Okay, the divided by three. That's going to be right, but let's do it. If you need a reason like kernels. We've updated your starter code check
Now this. No, I mean another one. And object is not calibal because you can't take. Okay, so I will do this. Okay, okay. Okay, the divided by three. That's going to be right, but let's do it. If you need a reason like kernels. We've updated your starter code check Um, I feel like anybody watching us do this. This is screaming at their computer screen or no. Yeah. I don't even know how do you reset your kernel. You're talking about. Basically, I told it. I told it something and it's not going to forget what I told it. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um
Um, I feel like anybody watching us do this. This is screaming at their computer screen or no. Yeah. I don't even know how do you reset your kernel. You're talking about. Basically, I told it. I told it something and it's not going to forget what I told it. Oh, okay. Yeah. Um Oh, okay. Yeah. Um. Yeah, see if that helps. Okay. Thank you for. Uh. Oh, I'm breaking shit. Oh, I don't know how I did that. Where are we? Need each candy? Yes, we're starting to clear everyone from the top. You shift them to our to one. Oh. Now I'm going to two. Three. I'm not fine
Oh, okay. Yeah. Um. Yeah, see if that helps. Okay. Thank you for. Uh. Oh, I'm breaking shit. Oh, I don't know how I did that. Where are we? Need each candy? Yes, we're starting to clear everyone from the top. You shift them to our to one. Oh. Now I'm going to two. Three. I'm not fine I'm not fine. I'm from the top. Okay. You run from the top. It happens in our workshops sometimes. Okay. Well, we're going to get this right if I'm rerunning everything. We'll get the right answer. Correct. Even though we shouldn't be correct. Okay. I'm going to think like I know the answer
I'm not fine. I'm from the top. Okay. You run from the top. It happens in our workshops sometimes. Okay. Well, we're going to get this right if I'm rerunning everything. We'll get the right answer. Correct. Even though we shouldn't be correct. Okay. I'm going to think like I know the answer I don't get pith on the answer. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Did you get it? No, I just got what it was arguing with me about. Tell me. Question it. I think it's not going to like this because. Okay. So. oh. Why are you printing to see the answer? then
I don't get pith on the answer. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Did you get it? No, I just got what it was arguing with me about. Tell me. Question it. I think it's not going to like this because. Okay. So. oh. Why are you printing to see the answer? then I just, I causing this Maybe yo, you can either I got three minutes before I got to jump all this golf. I'm going to get in three minutes because I don't need the camera to get in three minutes. I don't know. I'm going to get a hint. I'm going to get a hint. Module operator
I just, I causing this Maybe yo, you can either I got three minutes before I got to jump all this golf. I'm going to get in three minutes because I don't need the camera to get in three minutes. I don't know. I'm going to get a hint. I'm going to get a hint. Module operator Module operator. You probably want to use a module modellow operator percentage. It wasn't shown or above. I don't know why they gave us something that we're not even referencing to. Oh, there is. Oh, it might help. Ingerger remainder after a division of a by. Oh, that's so that's so perfect
Module operator. You probably want to use a module modellow operator percentage. It wasn't shown or above. I don't know why they gave us something that we're not even referencing to. Oh, there is. Oh, it might help. Ingerger remainder after a division of a by. Oh, that's so that's so perfect That's actually exactly what we're looking for. Let's do a orange line with the effect on that. I'm thinking that I'm�로a just smelling away this. I'll show you. picture to see now because I know that is healthy. So where you have two smash, remove two smash. Okay
That's actually exactly what we're looking for. Let's do a orange line with the effect on that. I'm thinking that I'm�로a just smelling away this. I'll show you. picture to see now because I know that is healthy. So where you have two smash, remove two smash. Okay Okay. Because you're changing the two smash at the bottom. So what I have is my code says total candy equals Alice candy plus Bob candy plus Carol candies, which is what you have for yum candies. You also need parentheses, I believe. How did it infer in the seas? I don't know
Okay. Because you're changing the two smash at the bottom. So what I have is my code says total candy equals Alice candy plus Bob candy plus Carol candies, which is what you have for yum candies. You also need parentheses, I believe. How did it infer in the seas? I don't know The young candies equation. I believe you need that parentheses. So yum candies equals Alice. It was adding earlier. Okay. My next line I have each candy, which would be yum candies for you equals total candy, which is yum candies for you. So make a new variable instead of yum candies
The young candies equation. I believe you need that parentheses. So yum candies equals Alice. It was adding earlier. Okay. My next line I have each candy, which would be yum candies for you equals total candy, which is yum candies for you. So make a new variable instead of yum candies I'm sorry, in front of you, I'm candies in front of you candies make a new variable. Oh, but whatever you want. Everyone's candies team candies. Okay. And then that equals yum candies with the modular three and then two smash shit equal this is silly, which is what I have
I'm sorry, in front of you, I'm candies in front of you candies make a new variable. Oh, but whatever you want. Everyone's candies team candies. Okay. And then that equals yum candies with the modular three and then two smash shit equal this is silly, which is what I have So it have to be you have to put it in. No, just just remove the negative one and just put your variable. The color variable and write down right. Oh, we got it. Okay. Okay. Well, I totally have to jump to the ball. And we got it. We got it. I'm really proud of us. And thank you and sweep
So it have to be you have to put it in. No, just just remove the negative one and just put your variable. The color variable and write down right. Oh, we got it. Okay. Okay. Well, I totally have to jump to the ball. And we got it. We got it. I'm really proud of us. And thank you and sweep And sweep you should like join us for all of them ever. I am going to raid your actually let's go alone with Jason and tell Jason hi for me. Yes, how do I wait? Oh, no, you're offline. Just kidding. I just said you were live. You're not live now. Okay. We'll do all that for. We'll start raid
And sweep you should like join us for all of them ever. I am going to raid your actually let's go alone with Jason and tell Jason hi for me. Yes, how do I wait? Oh, no, you're offline. Just kidding. I just said you were live. You're not live now. Okay. We'll do all that for. We'll start raid We'll start raid. Tell them hi. And right now. Yeah, okay. That makes more sense. Many because I like to read now. Okay. Bye everyone.
We'll start raid. Tell them hi. And right now. Yeah, okay. That makes more sense. Many because I like to read now. Okay. Bye everyone.
